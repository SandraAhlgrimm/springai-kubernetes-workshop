If you receive a malformed JSON response, fix it by:
1. Ensuring all JSON keys and string values are properly quoted with double quotes
2. Removing any trailing commas
3. Ensuring all brackets and braces are properly closed
4. Converting any single quotes to double quotes
5. Escaping any special characters in strings
