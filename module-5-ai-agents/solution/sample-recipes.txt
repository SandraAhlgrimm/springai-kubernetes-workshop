German Käsespätzle (Cheese Spätzle)

A traditional Swabian dish combining homemade spätzle with lots of cheese and fried onions.

Ingredients:
- 500g all-purpose flour
- 5 large eggs
- 200ml water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 400g grated Emmentaler or Gruyère cheese
- 2 large onions, sliced
- 3 tablespoons butter
- Fresh parsley for garnish
- Black pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. Prepare the Spätzle Dough
   Mix flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until you have a smooth, thick batter. The dough should be elastic and bubble slightly when stirred. Let rest for 10 minutes.

2. Cook the Spätzle
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Press the dough through a spätzle maker, colander with large holes, or use a spätzle board directly into the boiling water. Work in batches. The spätzle are done when they float to the surface (about 2-3 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

3. Fry the Onions
   Heat butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy (about 15-20 minutes). Remove and set aside.

4. Assemble the Dish
   In the same pan used for onions, add a layer of cooked spätzle. Sprinkle generously with grated cheese. Add another layer of spätzle and cheese. Repeat until all spätzle and cheese are used.

5. Melt and Serve
   Cover the pan with a lid and let the cheese melt over low heat (about 3-5 minutes). Give it a gentle stir to mix the melted cheese throughout.

6. Garnish
   Top with crispy fried onions, freshly ground black pepper, and chopped parsley.

Serve immediately while hot and cheesy!

Variations:
- Add crispy bacon pieces for extra flavor
- Mix in caramelized onions with the cheese layers
- Top with fried mushrooms
- Serve with a side salad to balance the richness

Tips:
- The dough consistency is key: it should be thick but still flow off the spoon
- Don't overcrowd the pot when cooking spätzle
- Use a combination of cheeses for more complex flavor
- The onions can be prepared ahead and reheated

Bavarian Potato Salad (Kartoffelsalat)

A warm, tangy potato salad with a light vinegar dressing - perfect alongside grilled meats.

Ingredients:
- 1kg waxy potatoes (Yukon Gold or fingerling)
- 1 medium onion, finely diced
- 250ml hot vegetable or beef broth
- 4 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 3 tablespoons sunflower oil
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh chives, chopped
- Optional: 4 slices bacon, diced

Instructions:

1. Cook the Potatoes
   Place unpeeled potatoes in a pot of cold, salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until tender but still firm (about 20-25 minutes depending on size). They should be easily pierced with a fork but not falling apart.

2. Prepare While Hot
   Drain and let cool slightly until you can handle them. Peel while still warm (the skin comes off easier). Slice into 1/4-inch thick rounds.

3. Make the Dressing
   In a small bowl, whisk together hot broth, vinegar, oil, mustard, sugar, salt, and pepper. The dressing should be warm.

4. Assemble the Salad
   Place sliced potatoes in a large bowl. Add diced onions. Pour the warm dressing over the potatoes. Gently fold to coat all pieces without breaking them.

5. Let It Rest
   Cover and let the salad rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. This allows the potatoes to absorb the dressing. Gently stir occasionally.

6. Optional Bacon
   If using bacon, fry until crispy, drain on paper towels, and crumble over the salad before serving.

7. Serve
   Garnish with fresh chives. Serve warm or at room temperature. The salad is even better the next day!

Tips:
- Use waxy potatoes, not russets - they hold their shape better
- Slice potatoes while warm for better dressing absorption
- Don't refrigerate before serving - serve at room temperature
- The salad should be moist but not swimming in dressing
- Add more hot broth if it seems too dry

Best Served With:
- Schnitzel
- Bratwurst
- Grilled meats
- Roast chicken

Classic Sauerbraten

A tender pot roast marinated in a sweet-and-sour mixture, a beloved German comfort food.

Ingredients:

For the Marinade:
- 2kg beef roast (rump or bottom round)
- 500ml red wine vinegar
- 500ml water
- 2 onions, sliced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 2 bay leaves
- 10 juniper berries
- 10 black peppercorns
- 5 cloves
- 2 tablespoons sugar

For Cooking:
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 100g gingerbread cookies (Lebkuchen), crumbled
- 100ml red wine
- Salt to taste

Instructions:

1. Prepare the Marinade (3-5 days ahead)
   Combine vinegar, water, onions, carrots, bay leaves, juniper berries, peppercorns, cloves, and sugar in a pot. Bring to a boil, then let cool completely.

2. Marinate the Meat
   Place the beef roast in a large non-reactive container (glass or ceramic). Pour the cooled marinade over the meat, ensuring it's completely submerged. Cover and refrigerate for 3-5 days, turning the meat once daily.

3. Prepare for Cooking
   Remove meat from marinade and pat dry. Strain the marinade, reserving the liquid and vegetables separately.

4. Brown the Meat
   Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the meat with salt and brown on all sides (about 10-15 minutes total).

5. Braise
   Add the reserved vegetables from the marinade around the meat. Pour in about 500ml of the marinade liquid. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Cover and braise for 2.5-3 hours, turning occasionally. The meat should be very tender.

6. Make the Sauce
   Remove the meat and keep warm. Strain the braising liquid, pressing on the vegetables to extract maximum flavor. Discard the solids.

7. Thicken the Sauce
   Return the liquid to the pot. Stir in crumbled gingerbread cookies and red wine. Simmer until the sauce thickens (about 10 minutes). Taste and adjust seasoning. The sauce should be sweet-sour and slightly spicy.

8. Slice and Serve
   Slice the meat against the grain. Arrange on a platter and pour sauce over the top. Serve with:
   - Potato dumplings (Kartoffelknödel)
   - Red cabbage
   - Spätzle
   - Potato pancakes

Tips:
- The longer you marinate, the more flavorful the meat
- Don't skip the gingerbread - it's essential for authentic flavor
- The sauce should coat the back of a spoon
- Leftovers are even better the next day

Traditional Sides:
- Red cabbage braised with apples
- Potato dumplings (Knödel)
- Buttered spätzle
- Crusty bread for sopping up sauce

Black Forest Cake (Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte)

The iconic German chocolate cake with cherries, whipped cream, and kirsch.

Ingredients:

For the Cake:
- 200g all-purpose flour
- 50g cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 6 large eggs
- 300g sugar
- 100ml vegetable oil
- 100ml hot water
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

For the Cherry Filling:
- 800g jarred sour cherries, drained (reserve juice)
- 100ml cherry juice
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 100g sugar

For Decoration:
- 200g dark chocolate, shaved or grated
- Fresh cherries with stems (optional)

Instructions:

1. Bake the Cake Layers
   Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease three 23cm round cake pans. Separate eggs. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. In another bowl, beat egg yolks with sugar until pale and fluffy. Mix in oil, hot water, and vanilla. Sift together flour, cocoa, and baking powder. Fold dry ingredients into yolk mixture alternately with egg whites. Divide batter among pans. Bake 25-30 minutes. Cool completely.

2. Prepare Cherry Filling
   Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cherry juice. Heat remaining juice with sugar in a saucepan. Stir in cornstarch mixture and cook until thickened. Add drained cherries. Remove from heat and stir in kirsch. Cool completely.

3. Make Whipped Cream
   Whip cream with powdered sugar, kirsch, and vanilla until stiff peaks form. Set aside about 1/3 for decoration.

4. Assemble the Cake
   Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Brush with kirsch. Spread with 1/3 of the whipped cream. Top with half the cherry filling. Repeat with second layer. Place third layer on top.

5. Frost and Decorate
   Cover entire cake with remaining whipped cream, creating a smooth finish. Press chocolate shavings onto the sides and top of the cake. Pipe rosettes of reserved cream on top and garnish each with a fresh cherry if desired.

6. Chill and Serve
   Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving to allow flavors to meld. Best served within 24 hours.

Tips:
- Use real kirsch, not cherry extract
- Drain cherries well to prevent soggy cake
- Cake layers can be made ahead and frozen
- For extra height, slice each layer horizontally
- Keep refrigerated due to fresh cream

Variation:
For a lighter version, use mascarpone mixed with whipped cream instead of pure whipped cream.
